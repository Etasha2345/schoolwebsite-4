                                    Raj (X) along with faculty member Ms. Divya Sood grabbed the opportunity to attend Collège Salvador Allende in Nantes, Paris. Each student was hosted by the French students and their families. While the Indian students
                                    became the ambassadors of their country to share all the richness of their customs & traditions, the French went out of their way to make this stay a memorable one by organizing endless activities such as, cooking,
                                    music lessons, dance, role play, hand ball, yoga apart from the regular classroom teaching. They ensured that their Indian friends discovered their entire region by taking them to beautiful castles, theme parks, the
                                    river side and to Buren's rings on Loire River. Attending class was a unique experience too as was the city tour. Biding Adieu was the most difficult part for all of us. Students exchanged small gifts to express their
                                    gratitude and shared their contact details to strengthen their connections. </p>

All the school activities became online. Now it has become rutine work. An online class
                                is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students
                                and their course instructor. Online courses use learning management systems to deliver course content, allowing students to submit assignments and communicate with peers and professors. Most online programs use either the
                                Blackboard or Canvas LMS. From the Blackboard landing page, learners can see grades, create an academic portfolio, and keep up with deadlines with a calendar. Canvas confers many of the same benefits of online education,
                                including an outcomes feature that displays students' mastery of course objectives. Many schools use an LMS for asynchronous courses, which allow learners to view recorded lectures and complete work at any time. However,
                                even if a course uses an LMS, students may still need to fulfill synchronous requirements such as live virtual sessions.</p>
